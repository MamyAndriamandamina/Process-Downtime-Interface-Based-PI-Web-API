This repository contains the complete .Net Core MVC Web application that we can use to deploy immediately on IIS or any Web hosting service.
This web interface allows user to view and interact with the plant downtime. 
Users can attach additional information that will help the understanding of the root cause of process downtime.
This web Application runs using .Net Core MVC Framework fed from OSISoft PI Web API.
For a better rendering of this interface, we strongly recommend users to use Google Chrome as web browser.
Thanks, Mamy :)
